   {
       builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
           options.UseSqlite(connectionString));
   }
   else
   {
       builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
           options.UseNpgsql(connectionString));
   }

   // Update CORS for production
   builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
   {
       options.AddDefaultPolicy(policy =>
       {
           policy.WithOrigins(
               "http://localhost:3000",
               "https://your-domain.railway.app" // Add your production domain
           )
           .AllowAnyMethod()

   ```typescript
   const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL ||
     (import.meta.env.MODE === 'production'
       ? 'https://your-backend-domain.railway.app'
       : 'http://localhost:5199');
   ```

### **Phase 4: Database Migration (5 minutes)**

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

#### **"App won't load"**
- Check Railway dashboard for deployment errors
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check backend logs for database connection issues

#### **"Users can't login"**
- Verify JWT_SECRET is set in production
- Check database connection
- Ensure user accounts exist in production database

#### **"Tasks not saving"**
- Check backend logs for database errors
- Verify PostgreSQL connection string
- Check for validation errors in API

#### **"Slow performance"**
- Check database query performance
- Monitor Railway metrics for CPU/memory usage
- Consider upgrading plan if needed

#### **"Real-time updates not working"**
- This is expected - implement polling or SignalR for real-time updates
- Current behavior: users see updates on page refresh

### **Emergency Procedures:**

#### **If App Goes Down:**
```bash
# Quick rollback to previous version:
git log --oneline -5                    # See recent commits
git revert HEAD                         # Undo last change
git push                               # Deploy previous version
```

#### **If Database Issues:**
```
1. Access Railway dashboard
2. Go to PostgreSQL service
3. Check connection metrics
4. Restore from automatic backup if needed
```

#### **If Complete Reset Needed:**
```
1. Export current data from database
2. Delete Railway project
3. Redeploy from scratch
4. Import data back
```
