# SESSION STATE - September 22, 2025

## üéØ MAIN ISSUE REMAINING
**Team member delete functionality still returns 403 Forbidden**

### Error Details:
```
DELETE http://192.168.0.125:5199/api/schedule/assignments/34 403 (Forbidden)
Error deleting assignment: AxiosError {message: 'Request failed with status code 403'}
```

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TODAY

### 1. Fixed Admin UI Elements
- ‚úÖ Dashboard button now hidden from team members (wrapped in `canAccessManagement`)
- ‚úÖ Database and Admin buttons already had proper restrictions
- ‚úÖ Only Manager/Admin users see: Dashboard, Analytics, Employees, Admin, Database buttons

### 2. Fixed Team Member Schedule Access
- ‚úÖ Team members can see their own schedule rows
- ‚úÖ Team members have full schedule functionality (drag & drop, resize, create)
- ‚úÖ Fixed User ID to Employee ID conversion in backend
- ‚úÖ Fixed team name display (shows "Structural" instead of "Mixed")
- ‚úÖ Removed read-only restrictions for team members

### 3. Backend Authorization Investigation
- ‚úÖ Confirmed delete endpoint has `[Authorize]` (correct)
- ‚úÖ Confirmed ScheduleService.DeleteAssignmentAsync() works (simple soft delete)
- ‚úÖ Tested with fresh JWT tokens - still gets 403

## üîç INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

### Authorization Setup:
- Controller level: `[Authorize]` on ScheduleController (line 14)
- Method level: `[Authorize]` on DeleteAssignment method (line 216)
- Policies defined in Program.cs but not used as default
- Fresh JWT token contains correct claims: `"role": "TeamMember"`

### Tested Solutions:
1. ‚ùå Logout/login (user tried, still 403)
2. ‚ùå Fresh JWT token generation (tested with curl, still 403)
3. ‚ùå Temporary `[AllowAnonymous]` (still got 401 due to controller-level auth)

## üö® NEXT STEPS FOR TOMORROW

### Priority 1: Fix Delete 403 Issue
The delete endpoint should work with `[Authorize]` for any authenticated user, but it's returning 403. Possible causes:

1. **Hidden Authorization Policy**: There might be a global policy or middleware blocking TeamMember role
2. **JWT Claims Mismatch**: The role claim format might not match what ASP.NET expects
3. **Database Permissions**: There might be database-level restrictions in ScheduleService
4. **Assignment Ownership**: The assignment might belong to a different user/team

### Debugging Plan:
1. Add detailed logging to DeleteAssignment method to see what user info is received
2. Check if there's a global authorization policy being applied
3. Test with Admin user to confirm endpoint works
4. Verify the assignment exists and belongs to the team member
5. Check JWT token claims format (currently uses long Microsoft schema URIs)

### Files Modified Today:
- `frontend/src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx` - Hidden dashboard button from team members
- `backend/DesignPlanner.Api/Controllers/ScheduleController.cs` - User ID to Employee ID conversion
- `backend/DesignPlanner.Data/Services/ScheduleService.cs` - Team name display fix
- `frontend/src/pages/TeamSchedule.tsx` - Removed read-only restrictions

## üìã TODO LIST STATUS
- ‚úÖ All major items completed except delete functionality
- üîÑ Delete issue requires deeper authorization debugging

## üîß CURRENT USER ACCESS
- Username: `iszczerb` (TeamMember role)
- Team: Structural (ID: 2)
- Can see own schedule, create/edit tasks
- Cannot delete tasks (403 error)

---
**Status**: 95% complete - only delete authorization issue remains
**Next Session**: Focus on authorization debugging and JWT claims investigation
